ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m @SickQuail, an enthusiastic tech explorer on a journey to join the dynamic world of DevSecOps!
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m fascinated by cybersecurity, software development, and all things tech innovation.
ðŸŒ± Currently diving into frontend web development through The Odin Project and Udemy.
ðŸŽ® In my free time, I enjoy creating pixel art and learning game development as a fun, creative outlet.
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to start as a pen tester, security analyst, or software developer, all while aiming to master the art of DevSecOps engineering.
ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on cool projects, learn from others, and share ideas!
